\section{Conclusion}

In this paper we have presented a method for modelling Carbon emission from smartphone data and a method for discerning six different driving modes. The Carbon emission model is quite stable with a standard deviation of 0.02. 

The K-means based method for discerning between driving modes is able to discern between four acceleration modes (forward, brake, left turn, and right turn) and two non-accelerating modes.
