abstract = {Recently, advanced navigation systems have been developed that provide users the ability to select not only a shortest-distance route and even the shortest-duration route (on the basis of real-time traffic congestion information) but also routes that minimize fuel consumption as well as greenhouse gas and pollutant emissions. In these ecorouting systems, fuel consumption and emission attributes are estimated for roadway links on the basis of the measured traffic volume, density, and average speed. Instead of standard travel time or distance attributes, these link attributes are then used as cost factors when an optimal route for any particular trip is selected. In addition to roadway congestion attributes, road grade factors also have an effect on fuel consumption and emissions. This study evaluated the effect of road grade on vehicle fuel consumption (and thus carbon dioxide [CO2] emissions). The real-world experimental results show that road grade does have significant effects on the fuel economy of light-duty vehicles both at the roadway link level and at the route level. Comparison of the measured fuel economy between a flat route and example hilly routes revealed that the vehicle fuel economy of the flat route is superior to that of the hilly routes by approximately 15\% to 20\%. This road grade effect will certainly play a significant role in advanced ecorouting navigation algorithms, in which the systems can guide drivers away from steep roadways to achieve better fuel economy and reduce CO2 emissions.},

abstract = {Calculating product carbon footprints (PCF) is a central function of Environmental Management Information Systems (EMIS). Collecting accurate data for EMIS in general and PCF in particular is a critical issue. Nowadays, emission data of transportation processes are mostly based on averages and estimations, as data on actual emissions of transportation processes are costly to collect. In this paper, we propose a cost-efficient system for real-time data gathering for PCF in transportation processes based on vehicle on-board systems and smartphones. We present the system architecture, outline the application logic and - based on a generic multi-echelon transportation network - we specify its application and integration into EMIS.},

abstract = {Driving style can characteristically be divided into two categories: \&\#x201C;typical\&\#x201D; (non-aggressive) and aggressive. Understanding and recognizing driving events that fall into these categories can aid in vehicle safety systems. Potentially-aggressive driving behavior is currently a leading cause of traffic fatalities in the United States. More often than not, drivers are unaware that they commit potentially-aggressive actions daily. To increase awareness and promote driver safety, we are proposing a novel system that uses Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) and smartphone based sensor-fusion (accelerometer, gyroscope, magnetometer, GPS, video) to detect, recognize and record these actions without external processing. Our system differs from past driving pattern recognition research by fusing related inter-axial data from multiple sensors into a single classifier. It also utilizes Euler representation of device attitude (also based on fused data) to aid in classification. All processing is done completely on the smartphone.},

It is an example of an important class of emerging mobile systems that combine the distributed processing capacity of the web with the personal reach of mobile technology. This paper documents and evaluates the running \{PEIR\} system, which includes mobile handset based \{GPS\} location data collection, and server-side processing stages such as \{HMM-based\} activity classification (to determine transportation mode); automatic location data segmentation into "trips''; lookup of traffic, weather, and other context data needed by the models; and environmental impact and exposure calculation using efficient implementations of established models. Additionally, we describe the user interface components of \{PEIR\} and present usage statistics from a two month snapshot of system use. The paper also outlines new algorithmic components developed based on experience with the system and undergoing testing for integration into \{PEIR\}, including: new map-matching and \{GSM-augmented\} activity classification techniques, and a selective hiding mechanism that generates believable proxy traces for times a user does not want their real location revealed.},

The most important pollutants emitted by road vehicles include: ozone precursors (CO, NOx, NMVOCs (3); greenhouse gases (CO2, CH4, N2O); acidifying substances (NH3, SO2); particulate matter mass (PM); carcinogenic species (PAHs (4) and POPs (5); toxic substances (dioxins and furans); heavy metals. All PM mass emission factors reported in this chapter refer to PM2.5, as the coarse fraction (PM2.5-10) is negligible in vehicle exhaust. Emission factors for particulate matter are presented in terms of particle number and surface area for different size ranges. Also, fuel (energy) consumption figures can be calculated. For NMVOCs, emission factors for 68 separate substances are provided. 1.2},

abstract = {Vehicle classification information is crucial to transportation planning, facility design, and operations. Traditional vehicle classification methods are either too expensive to be deployed for large areas or subject to errors under specific situations. In this paper, we propose methods to classify vehicles using \{GPS\} data extracted from mobile traffic sensors, which is considered to be low-cost especially for large areas of urban arterials. It is found that features related to the variations of accelerations and decelerations (e.g., the proportions of accelerations and decelerations larger than 1 meter per square second, and the standard deviations of accelerations and decelerations) are the most effective in terms of vehicle classification using \{GPS\} data. By classifying general trucks from passenger cars, the average misclassification rate is about 1.6\% for the training data, and 4.2\% for the testing data.},

abstract = {This paper reports on the analysis of on-road vehicle speed, emission, and fuel consumption data collected by four instrumented vehicles. Time-, distance-, and fuel-based average fuel consumption, as well as CO, HC, NOx, and soot emission factors, were derived. The influences of instantaneous vehicle speed on emissions and fuel consumption were studied. It was found that the fuel-based emission factors varied much less than the time- and distance-based emission factors as instantaneous speed changed. The trends are similar to the results obtained from laboratory tests. The low driving speed contributed to a significant portion of the total emissions over a trip. Furthermore, the on-road data were analyzed using the modal approach. The four standard driving modes are acceleration, cruising, deceleration, and idling. It was found that the transient driving modes (i.e., acceleration and deceleration) were more polluting than the steady-speed driving modes (i.e., cruising and idling) in terms of g/km and g/sec. These results indicated that the on-road emission measurement is feasible in deriving vehicle emissions and fuel consumption factors in urban driving conditions.},
