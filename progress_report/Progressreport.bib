abstract = {In the past 10 years, various work has been undertaken to collect data on the actual driving of European cars and to derive representative real-world driving cycles. A compilation and synthesis of this work is provided in this paper. In the frame of the European research project: ARTEMIS, this work has been considered to derive a set of reference driving cycles. The main objectives were as follows: to derive a common set of reference real-world driving cycles to be used in the frame of the ARTEMIS project but also in the frame of on-going national campaigns of pollutant emission measurements, to ensure the compatibility and integration of all the resulting emission data in the European systems of emission inventory; to ensure and validate the representativity of the database and driving cycles by comparing and taking into account all the available data regarding driving conditions; to include in three real-world driving cycles (urban, rural road and motorway) the diversity of the observed driving conditions, within sub-cycles allowing a disaggregation of the emissions according to more specific driving conditions (congested and free-flow urban). Such driving cycles present a real advantage as they are derived from a large database, using a methodology that was widely discussed and approved. In the main, these ARTEMIS driving cycles were designed using the available data, and the method of analysis was based to some extent on previous work. Specific steps were implemented. The study includes characterisation of driving conditions and vehicle uses. Starting conditions and gearbox use are also taken into account.},

However, results from studies of the association between acute air pollution exposure and risk of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) are inconsistent for fine particulate matter, and, although pathophysiological evidence indicates a plausible link between OHCA and ozone, none has been reported. Approximately 300 000 persons in the United States experience an OHCA each year, of which >90\% die. Understanding the association provides important information to protect public health.},

abstract = {\{PEIR\}, the Personal Environmental Impact Report, is a participatory sensing application that uses location data sampled from everyday mobile phones to calculate personalized estimates of environmental impact and exposure. It is an example of an important class of emerging mobile systems that combine the distributed processing capacity of the web with the personal reach of mobile technology. This paper documents and evaluates the running \{PEIR\} system, which includes mobile handset based \{GPS\} location data collection, and server-side processing stages such as \{HMM-based\} activity classification (to determine transportation mode); automatic location data segmentation into "trips''; lookup of traffic, weather, and other context data needed by the models; and environmental impact and exposure calculation using efficient implementations of established models. Additionally, we describe the user interface components of \{PEIR\} and present usage statistics from a two month snapshot of system use. The paper also outlines new algorithmic components developed based on experience with the system and undergoing testing for integration into \{PEIR\}, including: new map-matching and \{GSM-augmented\} activity classification techniques, and a selective hiding mechanism that generates believable proxy traces for times a user does not want their real location revealed.},

abstract = {This chapter provides the methodology, emission factors and relevant activity data to enable exhaust emissions to be calculated for the following categories of road vehicles: passenger cars light-duty vehicles (1) (< 3.5 t) heavy-duty vehicles (2) (> 3.5 t) and buses mopeds and motorcycles (NFR code 1.A.3.b.i) (NFR code 1.A.3.b.ii) (NFR code 1.A.3.b.iii) (NFR code 1.A.3.b.iv) It does not cover non-exhaust emissions such as fuel evaporation from vehicles (NFR code 1.A.3.b.v), tyre wear and brake wear (NFR code 1.A.3.b.vi), or road wear (NFR code 1.A.3.b.vii). The most important pollutants emitted by road vehicles include: ozone precursors (CO, NOx, NMVOCs (3); greenhouse gases (CO2, CH4, N2O); acidifying substances (NH3, SO2); particulate matter mass (PM); carcinogenic species (PAHs (4) and POPs (5); toxic substances (dioxins and furans); heavy metals. All PM mass emission factors reported in this chapter refer to PM2.5, as the coarse fraction (PM2.5-10) is negligible in vehicle exhaust. Emission factors for particulate matter are presented in terms of particle number and surface area for different size ranges. Also, fuel (energy) consumption figures can be calculated. For NMVOCs, emission factors for 68 separate substances are provided. 1.2},

@article{Pandey2011,
abstract = {Increasing greenhouse gaseous concentration in the atmosphere is perturbing the environment to cause grievous global warming and associated consequences. Following the rule that only measurable is manageable, mensuration of greenhouse gas intensiveness of different products, bodies, and processes is going on worldwide, expressed as their carbon footprints. The methodologies for carbon footprint calculations are still evolving and it is emerging as an important tool for greenhouse gas management. The concept of carbon footprinting has permeated and is being commercialized in all the areas of life and economy, but there is little coherence in definitions and calculations of carbon footprints among the studies. There are disagreements in the selection of gases, and the order of emissions to be covered in footprint calculations. Standards of greenhouse gas accounting are the common resources used in footprint calculations, although there is no mandatory provision of footprint verification. Carbon footprinting is intended to be a tool to guide the relevant emission cuts and verifications, its standardization at international level are therefore necessary. Present review describes the prevailing carbon footprinting methods and raises the related issues.},

@article{Ristovski2005,
abstract = {A comprehensive study of the particle and carbon dioxide emissions from a fleet of six dedicated liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) powered and five unleaded petrol (ULP) powered new Ford Falcon Forte passenger vehicles was carried out on a chassis dynamometer at four different vehicle speeds--0 (idle), 40, 60, 80 and 100 km h(-1). Emission factors and their relative values between the two fuel types together with a statistical significance for any difference were estimated for each parameter. In general, LPG was found to be a 'cleaner' fuel, although in most cases, the differences were not statistically significant owing to the large variations between emissions from different vehicles. The particle number emission factors ranged from 10(11) to 10(13) km(-1) and was over 70\% less with LPG compared to ULP. Corresponding differences in particle mass emission factor between the two fuels were small and ranged from the order of 10 microg km(-1) at 40 to about 1000 microg km(-1) at 100 km h(-1). The count median particle diameter (CMD) ranged from 20 to 35 nm and was larger with LPG than with ULP in all modes except the idle mode. Carbon dioxide emission factors ranged from about 300 to 400 g km(-1) at 40 km h(-1), falling with increasing speed to about 200 g km(-1) at 100 km h(-1). At all speeds, the values were 10\% to 18\% greater with ULP than with LPG.},
