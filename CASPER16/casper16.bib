abstract = {{\{}PEIR{\}}, the Personal Environmental Impact Report, is a participatory sensing application that uses location data sampled from everyday mobile phones to calculate personalized estimates of environmental impact and exposure. It is an example of an important class of emerging mobile systems that combine the distributed processing capacity of the web with the personal reach of mobile technology. This paper documents and evaluates the running {\{}PEIR{\}} system, which includes mobile handset based {\{}GPS{\}} location data collection, and server-side processing stages such as {\{}HMM-based{\}} activity classification (to determine transportation mode); automatic location data segmentation into "trips''; lookup of traffic, weather, and other context data needed by the models; and environmental impact and exposure calculation using efficient implementations of established models. Additionally, we describe the user interface components of {\{}PEIR{\}} and present usage statistics from a two month snapshot of system use. The paper also outlines new algorithmic components developed based on experience with the system and undergoing testing for integration into {\{}PEIR{\}}, including: new map-matching and {\{}GSM-augmented{\}} activity classification techniques, and a selective hiding mechanism that generates believable proxy traces for times a user does not want their real location revealed.},

abstract = {The paper presents a framework for public traffic assignment that builds on the probit-based model of Sheffi and Powell [Sheffi, Y., Powell, W.B., 1981. A comparison of stochastic and deterministic traffic assignment over congested networks. Transportation Res. B. 15 (1), 53-64; Sheffi, Y., Powell, W.B., 1982. An algorithm, for the equilibrium assignment problem with random link Times. Networks 12 (2), 191-207.]. Hereby, the problems with overlapping routes that occur in many public transport models can be avoided. The probit-based model with modifications similar to the principles in Nielsen [Nielsen, O.A., 1996. Do stochastic traffic assignment models consider differences in road users utility functions? Twentyfourth European Transport Forum (PTRC Annual Meeting). London, UK, Seminar M.] is used as a starting point. This makes it possible to describe passengers' different preferences towards different sub-modes and against transfers. This also considers dependencies of choices through chains of sub-modes. The simulation of perceived travel times is extended to describe differences in the distribution of travel- and waiting times for different sub-modes. Parallel lines are frequency aggregated in order to handle waiting times appropriately. Initial tests on a full-scale case show that the methodology can describe route choices in public transport very well. This is both due to the model's ability to describe overlapping routes and due to the many different coefficients, error components and distributions that make it possible to calibrate the model. In practice, the many parameters might also be the main weakness, since this complicates the calibration. At the end of the paper, proposals to coefficients are presented based on a Danish SP-analysis. This demonstrated the applicability of the method. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

abstract = {This article reviews a number of topics related to the modelling and genera- tion of route choice sets, specifically for applications in large networks. It synthesizes existing knowledge using a conceptual framework, and addresses in what respects route choice differ from other travel choices. It shows that it is advantageous to distinguish the processes of choice set formation and choice per se, but also to explicitly separate the modelling steps of choice set generation and choice modelling. The article discusses the various purposes for which route choice sets may be used and what these mean for practi- cal choice set modelling. A generic conceptual scheme is presented relating the distinct key elements of the known route choice set generation approaches aimed at their classification and characterization. Some indications for their empirical validity are presented derived from applications to various uni-modal and multi-modal networks.},

abstract = {Several route choice models are reviewed in the context of the stochastic user equilibrium problem. The traffic assignment problem has been extensively studied in the literature. Several models were developed focusing mainly on the solution of the link flow pattern for congested urban areas. The behavioural assumption governing route choice, which is the essential part of any traffic assignment model, received relatively much less attention. The core of any traffic assignment method is the route choice model. In the wellknown deterministic case, a simple choice model is assumed in which drivers choose their best route. The assumption of perfect knowledge of travel costs has been long considered inadequate to explain travel behaviour. Consequently, probabilistic route choice models were developed in which drivers were assumed to minimize their perceived costs given a set of routes. The objective of the paper is to review the different route choice models used to solve the traffic assignment problem. Focus is on the different model structures. The paper connects some of the route choice models proposed long ago, such as the logit and probit models, with recently developed models.
